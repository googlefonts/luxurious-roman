This typeface was designed to accompany the Luxurious Script. Luxurious Roman is a semi-hand lettered font with inconsistent serifs and a subtle bouncy look to create that 'imperfect' hand calligraphed feel.

It comes with Latin Character sets including Western, Central, and Vietnamese language support.
